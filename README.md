# Cactus Heaven :cactus:
## Small Assignment 4 for T-514-VEFT

We have been contacted by a new retailer in the cactus biz called Cactus Heaven. They love
cactus and want everyone to feel the same way! They started out as a small company with around
500-1000 daily users to their website https://cactus-heaven.com (i’m not sure if this actually
exists… but you can check!) but they are rapidly expanding and their daily users are now around
4000-5000. The codebase they currently have is a monolithic application which is neither scalable
nor easy to deploy, and they want to move to the world of microservices! That’s where we come
in, let’s step in to the land of wonders called Microservice-Land!
